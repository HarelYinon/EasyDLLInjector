# EasyDLLInjector

A simple UI written in cpp language that allow to choose process to inject dll to it and run a function from it.
Realized by winapi.

# Limits
Currently work only for windows 32 bit applications.
The selected dll is written in the code, still dont have the option to let the user choose the dll to inject in the GUI.
Didn't take care the vulnerabilities.

# Note
The EasyDLLInjector.exe and MemoryView.dll must be in the same folder.

# Licence
Do whatever you want.
