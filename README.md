# EasyDLLInjector

A simple UI written in cpp language that allow to choose process to inject dll to it and run a function from it.
Realized by winapi.

# Limits
Currently work only for windows 32 bit applications.
The selected dll is written in the code, still dont have an option in UI to let the user choose the dll to inject.
Didn't care the vulnerabilities. and the attached MemoryView.dll still not finished.

# Licence
Do whatever you want with those code files, but I wish you would send me a message if my code was helpful to you so i can brag a little.
